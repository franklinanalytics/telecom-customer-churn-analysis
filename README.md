# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction

Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. This project aims to analyze customer data to identify key factors contributing to churn and provide insights to help reduce customer attrition. The dataset used for this analysis comes from a telecom provider and includes customer demographics, service subscriptions, and billing details.

## 2. Data Overview

The dataset consists of multiple columns, including:

* Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

* Gender: Male or Female.

* Senior Citizen: Indicates if a customer is a senior citizen (1) or not (0).

* Tenure: Number of months a customer has been with the company.

* MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer each month.

* TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer.

* Contract Type: The type of contract a customer has (Month-to-month, One-year, Two-year).

* Churn: Whether the customer has left the service (Yes/No).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1 Customer Demographics

The dataset includes customers of different genders and age groups.

The distribution of senior citizens in the dataset was analyzed.

### 3.2 Tenure and Churn Patterns

Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.

Longer tenure customers tend to remain loyal.

### 3.3 Billing Analysis

Monthly and total charges were examined to identify trends among churned customers.

Customers with higher monthly charges have a higher likelihood of churn.

### 3.4 Contract Type & Churn Rate

Month-to-month contract customers show a significantly higher churn rate compared to long-term contract customers.

## 4. Key Findings & Insights

Senior citizens do not significantly contribute to higher churn.

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to leave.

High monthly charges correlate with increased churn rates.

Long-term contracts help reduce churn rates.

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendations

Encourage customers to switch from month-to-month contracts to long-term contracts.

Offer discounts or loyalty rewards to high-paying customers.

Implement targeted retention strategies for customers with short tenure.

## 6. Next Steps

Perform predictive modeling to classify customers likely to churn.

Develop customer retention strategies based on identified patterns.

Publish findings and code on GitHub for portfolio showcasing.
